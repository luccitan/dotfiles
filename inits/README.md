# Init files

This folder contains files that need to be used for set-up / initialisation :

- `home` contains files that should be put in `$HOME` / `~` folder. It contains shell basic files accorded with `shell` / `zsh` / `bash` / `...` configurations

## Usage

Simply copy-paste files in their target directory at setup. Then you can do any modification you want to expand, but at least you get the minimum configuration ready to be extended from synced/saved configurations with **dotfiles**
